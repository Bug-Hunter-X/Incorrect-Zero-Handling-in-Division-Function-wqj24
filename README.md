# Incorrect Zero Handling in Division Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript involving the handling of zero values in division operations.  The `foo` function is intended to divide `a` by `b`, but it incorrectly handles cases where either `a` or `b` is zero.  The solution shows how to correct this to produce accurate results or handle the potential errors.
